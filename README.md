# BisonWork
A repository to hold just the work I did for Big Bang Bison, a game made in Unity.

Most of this code is for the behavior of the Bison in BBB. There are multiple iterations of some files, look in the v2 folder and read Herd.cs and HerdAgent.cs to understand most of the code. Essentially each bison's movement is determined by a combination of behaviors as in Craig Reynolds' boids algorithm. There are also a couple changes made to give players more control over bison, such as an alignment behavior, and an alternate set of behaviors when not being driven by a player.
